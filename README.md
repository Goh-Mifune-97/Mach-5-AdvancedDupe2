# Mach-5-AdvancedDupe2
Just a little something for my friend Shaun.
To set this up, you just need to put the .txt file in the advdupe2 folder in the garrysmod data directory. All you need to do to get in is make sure the collisions for the dome are turned off, jump in crouch down, enter a seat, and you're in. To be safe, I reccomend that you enable the dome's collisions to keep the minges and bullets out of your hair.
